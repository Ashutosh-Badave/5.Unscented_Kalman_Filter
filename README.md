# Sensor Fusion UKF Highway Project

In this project, I have implemented an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of multiple cars on a highway using noisy lidar and radar measurements. Tunning of process noise due to longitudinal and yaw acceleration is done as well as init process matrix is tunned as per the first measurement from sensor. Furthermore, RMSE values are calculated and compared with threshold RMSE to check the correct tunning of above parameters.

`main.cpp` is using `highway.h` to create a straight 3 lane highway environment with 3 traffic cars and the main ego car at the center. 
The viewer scene is centered around the ego car and the coordinate system is relative to the ego car as well. The ego car is green while the 
other traffic cars are blue. The traffic cars will be accelerating and altering their steering to change lanes. Each of the traffic car's has
it's own UKF object generated for it, and will update each indidual one during every time step.

The red spheres above cars represent the (x,y) lidar detection and the purple lines show the radar measurements with the velocity magnitude along the detected angle. The Z axis is not taken into account for tracking, so you are only tracking along the X/Y axis.

## Other Important Dependencies
* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
 * PCL 1.2

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./ukf_highway`

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) as much as possible.

## Generating Additional Data

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar modify the code in `highway.h` to alter the cars. Also check out `tools.cpp` to
change how measurements are taken, for instance lidar markers could be the (x,y) center of bounding boxes by scanning the PCD environment
and performing clustering. This is similar to what was done in Sensor Fusion Lidar Obstacle Detection.
